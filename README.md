# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Two players take turns to mark spaces in a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their symbols (X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If all nine spaces are filled and no player has won, the game is declared a draw.
